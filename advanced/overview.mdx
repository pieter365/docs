## Overview

This section covers advanced topics for extending Claude Code through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Learn how to build custom integrations that enable Claude Code to work with your specific tools and workflows.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI systems to integrate with external tools and data sources through a standardized interface.

## Use Cases

MCP servers enable powerful workflows:

### Development Tools

- **Component Libraries**: Convert between Storybook stories and React components
- **API Testing**: Integrate with Postman, Insomnia, or custom API tools
- **Database Management**: Query and manage databases directly from Claude Code

### Design Workflows

- **Figma Integration**: Generate code from Figma designs (built-in MCP available)
- **Asset Management**: Access and manage design assets
- **Documentation Sync**: Keep docs synchronized with designs

### Project Management

- **Issue Tracking**: Create and update GitHub issues, Linear tasks, or Jira tickets
- **Documentation**: Auto-generate docs from code and sync with Notion or Confluence
- **CI/CD**: Trigger builds, check status, and manage deployments

## Architecture Patterns

### Local Servers (Stdio)

Best for:
- Development tools
- File system operations
- Fast, local-only operations

```typescript
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Remote Servers (HTTP)

Best for:
- Cloud services
- Shared team resources
- Enterprise integrations

```typescript
const transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({ port: 3000 });
await server.connect(transport);
```

## Building Your First MCP Server

The typical flow for creating an MCP server:

```typescript
// 1. Initialize the server
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "my-integration",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// 2. Define tools
server.tool(
  "my_tool",
  { param: z.string() },
  async ({ param }) => {
    // Implementation
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: result }] };
  }
);

// 3. Connect transport
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security">
    - Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
    - Never execute arbitrary code
    - Implement proper authentication for remote servers
    - Use environment variables for sensitive data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    - Always wrap tool implementations in try-catch
    - Return structured error responses
    - Log errors for debugging
    - Provide helpful error messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance">
    - Cache expensive operations
    - Use async operations appropriately
    - Implement rate limiting for API calls
    - Monitor memory usage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Testing">
    - Test each tool independently
    - Create integration tests
    - Use the MCP inspector for debugging
    - Test error scenarios
  </Accordion>
